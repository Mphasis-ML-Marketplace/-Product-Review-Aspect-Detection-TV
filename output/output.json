 "review": "Very good COLOR REPRODUCTION, which is my FIRST PRIORITY. A very similar, but other maker's TV went back due to image flaws ~~~ it had pixilization in areas of fast motion ... this one has none. It is easy with this model to guess resolution, just by image clarity per channel.  The DVD player is a definite bonus and works well (so far).  The sound is as good as can be expected from these sized speakers -- very tinny; but this can be fixed with a good quality sound bar.  I'm using it 100% in 12V mode in my little solar powered RV in the woods, and draws under 48 max Watts ... a good thing for a TV powered by the sun.  Overall --- A keeper here, and hope yours will be the same.",
